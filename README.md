# Batch Image Chooser

Python GUI to select images with same name from two folders, good for selecting between two images after batch processing.

Select folder 1 and folder 2 to compare, and output folder to copy selected image to this folder.

Use arrow keys (or buttons) to select between two images, after that, a copy of selected image will be on "output" folder

## TO-DO

[ ] Enhancements on PIL image resizing, process taking long to complete
[ ] Test other image formats, now allowing only PNG and JPG because that's what I needed it for
